# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Your GitHub profile contains a non-default profile picture and at least some information about you. Experience shows pull requests from accounts missing those characteristics are likely to reflect their owner's attention to detail.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Titles need to be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html) properly. Don't be lazy. For help with this, see [Online Capitalize Tool](https://headlinecapitalization.com). Use *Chicago Manual of Style* rules.
- Keep descriptions short and simple.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Order titles alphabetically within each category.
- Group commands for checking, enabling and disabling in one code block.
- Never remove or replace commands for an older OS version. Instead, mark them as such. Look for existing examples of how to do this properly. The only exception are obvious and verified non-working commands.
- Always use code fencing with the `bash` descriptor.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Pull requests that are not fixed according to the comments within one week will be closed.
- Always use `folder` instead of `directory` in titles and descriptions.

Thank you for your suggestions!
