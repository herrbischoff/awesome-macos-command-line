# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Your GitHub profile contains a non-default profile picture and at least some
  information about you. Experience shows pull requests from accounts missing
  those characteristics are likely to reflect their owner's attention to
  detail.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a
  duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Titles need to be [capitalized][1] properly. Don't be lazy. For help with
  this, see [Online Capitalize Tool][2]. Use *Chicago Manual of Style* setting.
  rules.
- Keep descriptions short and simple.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Order titles alphabetically within each category.
- Group commands for checking, enabling and disabling in one code block.
- Never remove or replace commands for an older OS version. Instead, mark them
  as such. Look for existing examples of how to do this properly. The only
  exception are obvious and verified non-working commands.
- Always use code fencing with the `sh` descriptor.
- Check your spelling and grammar. I am not a native English speaker as well 
  but I try my best. You should too.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Pull requests that are not fixed according to the comments within one week
  will be closed.
- Always use `folder` instead of `directory` in titles and descriptions.
- All flowing text needs a hard line-wrap at 80 characters. Commands and long
  URL are excepted.
- When referring to an OS, use the correct version number and name, like: macOS
  10.15 (Catalina) or OS X 10.11 (El Capitan).

Thank you for your suggestions!
