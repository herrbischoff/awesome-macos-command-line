# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Your GitHub profile contains a non-default profile picture and at least some information about you. Experience shows pull requests from accounts missing those characteristics are likely to reflect their owner's attention to detail.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Titles need to be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html) properly. Don't be lazy. For help with this, see [Online Capitalize Tool](https://headlinecapitalization.com). Use *Chicago Manual of Style* rules.
- Keep descriptions short and simple.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Order titles alphabetically within each category.
- Group commands for checking, enabling and disabling in one code block.
- Always use code fencing with the `bash` descriptor.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Pull requests that are not fixed according to the comments within one week will be closed.
- Always use `folder` instead of `directory` in titles and descriptions.

Thank you for your suggestions!
